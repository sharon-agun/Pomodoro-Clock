# Pomodoro-Clock

## Overview

This is a simple Pomodoro clock application built using Python's `tkinter` library. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features

- Set custom work and break durations.
- Start, pause, and reset the timer.
- Sound notifications at the end of each work and break session.
- Simple and user-friendly graphical interface.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. This application uses the `tkinter` library, which is usually included with standard Python installations.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/axxns/pomodoro-clock.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd pomodoro-clock
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python pomodoro.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Set the desired work and break durations.
2. Click the "Start" button to initiate the Pomodoro timer.
3. Use the "Pause" button to pause the timer temporarily.
4. Press "Reset" to stop the timer and reset the durations.
5. Sound notifications will indicate the end of each work and break session.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the code to suit your preferences. You can modify the default work and break durations, change the notification sound, or adjust the appearance of the graphical interface.
